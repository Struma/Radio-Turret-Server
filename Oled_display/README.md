# Oled Display

A headless server should have some kind of status indicator. A $3 Oled display from Ebay is perfect -though it was supposed to be white not yellow/blue, Oh well!-

I use the oled on the server to show basic information about the system.

* Shows current IP
* Shows load averages for 1, 5, 15min
* Shows memory usage
* Shows disk space
